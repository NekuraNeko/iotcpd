NAME
    iotcpd - a stdio to tcp redirector daemon

SYNOPSIS
    iotcpd --num-daemons 8 --daemon "squidGuard -c sg/adblock.conf" --ipv4 "10.20.30.40" --port "1234"

DESCRIPTION
    iotcpd is a generic STDIO to TCP redirector daemon. it can start multiple identical non-networking enabled daemons that only interact via stdin/stdout and query them based on requests received via TCP. the request is sent to the stdin of one of the daemons that is available, read from it's stdout, sent to the requester via TCP and then the connection is torn down.
    basically an inetd/xinetd/tcpserver on crack.
    epoll API functions are used to handle incoming connections.


example of how this fits in with having multiple squidguard daemons that can talk via TCP:

          ---------------------      ---- squidguard
         |                     |    |
---------+      iotcpd server  +----+---- squidguard
  TCP    |                     |    |
          ---------------------      ...
                                    |
                                     ---- squidguard

 $ ./iotcpd --num-daemons 8 --daemon "squidGuard -c sg/adblock.conf" --ipv4 "10.20.30.40" --port "1234"

 dependencies
 - epoll aware OS (Linux >=2.6, FreeBSD)
 - >=net-proxy/squidguard-1.5_beta-r1
 - net-analyzer/netcat6 (from http://netcat6.sourceforge.net/) for testing


 how to compile/test

 $ make && ./iotcpd --num-daemons 8

  # in a different terminal
 $ bash test_adblock.sh a
 $ bash test_adblock.sh b
 $ bash test_adblock.sh c

 sending USR1 and USR2 signals will provide with detailed statistics on the innerworkings of the redirector service:

 $ kill -USR1 `pidof iotcpd`
